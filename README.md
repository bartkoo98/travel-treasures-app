# Travel Treasures - share the opportunity
## About:
At this point it is my biggest Spring web project, but I stopped working on it in favor of a new one(influx). The application is running on a test profile with H2 database.
The app relies on users uploading travel opportunities. It focuses on the backend layer, with a total basic GUI. The project was for science, mainly thymeleaf.
Maybe one day I'll come back to add some functionality like adding integration tests, adding a new admin function like deleting finds and user accounts.

## What I used?
- Java
- Spring Framework
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf
- H2 database/SQL
- Liquibase
- HTML/CSS

## How to run?
Download project and open with Intellij, later press shift + F10 or right click on TravelTreasuresFinalApplication and run.
Application should launch on http://localhost:8080
